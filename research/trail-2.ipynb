      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 484:\n",

      "That's a very good question.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 486:\n",

      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 487:\n",
      "And something that I also notice is that they're looking to understand exactly how scalable AI can be.\n",

      "🧠 Chunk 488:\n",
      "So how scalable the solutions can be in order for their businesses to also grow with the solution in the future. Arnon 01:23 Right?\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 489:\n",
      "So the solutions that they want to develop with AI need to be scalable enough to grow with the business. And also having a strong technical team capable of handling AI development and, deployment is crucial.\n",

      "🧠 Chunk 490:\n",

      "So they will miss this big opportunity, which is leveraging AI for their specific business model.\n",

      "🧠 Chunk 496:\n",
      "But as I said, not all tech startups or startups as a whole need to incorporate AI into the business model. Arnon 02:27 Right?\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 497:\n",
      "So while AI can provide significant advantages, its necessity depends on, for example, the nature of the business and the problem it aims to solve.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 498:\n",
      "And I think startups should assess whether AI genuinely adds value to their core offering and aligns with their strategic goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 499:\n",
      "Because for some, traditional methods might be more efficient in terms of cost, also more effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 500:\n",
      "So incorporating AI just for the sake of it can lead to, like, unnecessary complexity and expenses without meaningful benefits, especially if you don't have, like, a lot of data to feed your AI systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 501:\n",
      "Larissa 03:09 Do companies come to Abel without AI and then want to incorporate it? How how's that process work? Arnon 03:15 Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 502:\n",
      "I mean, we have seen a lot of partners coming to us asking on how they could leverage AI to the benefit of their own businesses, and this is also something that we could do.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 503:\n",
      "So we also work on this ideation phase, so by combining their ideas with all of the things that we could do in terms of AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 504:\n",
      "So we also try and incorporate this AI consultancy service while interacting with partners and then use that to maybe provide them a very easy to understand and a very initial idea of how this AI system or how this AI idea could incorporate to their application.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 505:\n",
      "Right? Arnon 03:54\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 506:\n",
      "And what we have seen so far is that most of them usually come to us with some data, and then we are capable of generating a very quick prototype and show them how this would work.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 507:\n",
      "But even for those partners that do not necessarily have data, we are capable of, you know, at least creating synthetic data to have a proof of concept and show them how this would work in the future in a way that we could develop something that is future proof.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 508:\n",
      "So it's prepared for whenever they have a lot of data, they probably will have this AI system working and ready to perform what they're intended to do. Larissa 04:32\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 509:\n",
      "Oh, that's really cool. So then just in general, what are we building at Able whether or not this with AI or not, but or how are we incorporating AI? Arnon 04:41 Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 510:\n",
      "Let let me focus more on the AI aspect of it. So we are building a lot of things for our partners and also internally.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 511:\n",
      "So internally, we're working with agents and generative AI to build chatbots.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 512:\n",
      "So we have couple of different strategies where we have seen that AI can help us be more efficient in terms of understanding documents, interacting with people, and eventually also helping in engineering. Arnon 05:08\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 513:\n",
      "So we have seen a lot of benefit of using AI in our engineering teams by helping them to create automatic tasks, to increase the overall quality of our systems, to help us better understand the context of the code that we are building.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 514:\n",
      "So this is one of the ways that we are currently working with AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 515:\n",
      "But then I would also say that there's this component about AgenTek AI, where we have seen that there is a lot of possibility for us to use this great capability of AI to analyze massive amounts of data and combine this with our expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 516:\n",

      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 960:\n",
      "Without explainability, investment committees default to human judgment, which they understand and can justify to their own investors. There’s also the matter of accountability and risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 961:\n",
      "If a deal goes wrong, fund managers must answer to their limited partners. Relying on AI doesn’t absolve them of blame.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 962:\n",
      "This incentivizes cautious use: AI might be an advisor, but rarely the final word. Building trust in AI tools takes time – often by starting with low-risk tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 963:\n",
      "For instance, a firm might first use AI to automate mundane data gathering or to double-check models, gradually gaining confidence in the tool’s reliability.\n",

      "Industry experts highlight that trust must also extend to AI vendors.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 965:\n",
      "According to Bain & Company’s Richard Lichtenstein, a “lack of trustworthy vendor solutions” is a challenge – few off-the-shelf AI products have proven they can consistently deliver on PE use cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 966:\n",
      "Apparently, many funds have tried third-party analytics platforms that promised to revolutionize sourcing or forecasting, only to find the results underwhelming or not fully credible to deal teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 967:\n",
      "This has made some PE investors skeptical of vendors’ hype. To overcome these trust issues, PE firms are increasingly demanding explainable and auditable AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 968:\n",
      "They want models where assumptions can be examined and stress-tested. A potential strategy to achieve that is developing in-house AI capabilities, so they can retain full control and understanding of the algorithms.\n",
      "\n",

      "🧠 Chunk 971:\n",
      "In theory, today’s AI – with state-of-the-art predictive analytics and massive language models – could transform how investment decisions are made. In practice, adoption has been slow and uneven.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 972:\n",
      "Many PE firms are still “on the digital sidelines”, lagging behind other financial sectors in AI uptake​. A recent global benchmarking study by McKinsey found less than 20% of institutional investors feel “ready” to incorporate AI and other future technologies into their processes​. Another industry poll by the World Economic Forum revealed that only 2% of PE firms expect to realize significant AI-driven value by 2025, even though 93% anticipate at least moderate benefits from AI in the long run​.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 973:\n",
      "In other words, nearly everyone believes AI is important, but almost no one thinks they’re getting major value from it today. Why the disconnect?\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 974:\n",
      "One reason is that cutting-edge AI often doesn’t fit neatly into real-world constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 975:\n",
      "Academic researchers might develop a novel machine learning model that predicts company defaults or market shifts with impressive accuracy on historical data.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 976:\n",
      "But a PE firm trying to implement that model faces hurdles: Do we have the required data (and rights to use it)? Does the model output make sense to our decision-makers?\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 977:\n",
      "How do we integrate it into our due diligence workflow or investment committee reviews?\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 978:\n",
      "The latest research often assumes ideal conditions – complete datasets, clear objective functions – which rarely exist in the messy reality of private markets. Moreover, PE firms are typically lean operations when it comes to tech.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 979:\n",
      "Unlike big banks, a PE fund might not have a large IT and analytics division. Lichtenstein notes that even “large” PE funds might have just 1–3 data scientists for the whole firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 980:\n",
      "This limited in-house expertise means there’s a capacity gap – few people to interpret state-of-art academic AI research or rebuild it for the firm’s needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 981:\n",
      "PE investors can’t “throw an army of engineers” at the problem of customizing AI tools, so the latest innovations often remain stuck in papers and prototypes.\n",

      "🧠 Chunk 982:\n",
      "It’s telling that most PE funds are only experimenting at a small scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 983:\n",
      "McKinsey found that while about 60% of PE portfolio companies had at least a pilot in generative AI, only ~5% had scaled any AI initiative to production across the business​\n",
      "The gap is also evident in outcomes versus expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 984:\n",
      "Private investors widely agree AI will be transformative, yet current deal outcomes rarely cite “AI” as a differentiator.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 985:\n",
      "For example, Bain's recent survey of PE investors showed 83% wanted to see companies they acquire be ‘AI data ready’, but only 40% of evaluated targets met that bar​. Similarly, three-quarters of investors wanted targets to have a bold AI strategy, but only one-third of companies delivered on that​.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 986:\n",
      "This suggests PE firms are hungry for AI advantages, but the market hasn’t caught up – many companies (and PE internal teams) are still at the starting line of the AI race.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Chunk 987:\n",
