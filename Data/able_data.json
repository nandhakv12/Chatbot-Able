We are fortunate to have forged enduring partnerships with impactful non-profit organizations and companies that share our passion for making a difference beyond profit margins.\nThis ethos is a fundamental part of our identity and vision. Our journey is a testament to the belief that technology can be a force for good, and our dedication to this principle continues to drive us forward.\n“Partnering with Able always feels seamless. They combine technical excellence with a deep understanding and genuine care for our social mission, making them more than just a partner—they’re a critical extension of our team.”\n—David Henderson, CTO\nThe Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy (PICI) brings together Nobel prize-winning scientists, providing them with funding and resources to advance cancer treatment through immunotherapy.\nWhat we’ve built together: Able created a platform for the institute's scientists, helping them to collaborate and share information to contribute to their goal of making cancer a curable disease.\nGiving Credit is a social credit network focused on reducing financial exclusion in low-income communities. It brings transparency to informal lending, offers loan guarantees for peer-lenders, and reports loan repayments to credit bureaus, helping reduce reliance on exploitative loans while providing tax deductions for loan losses.\nWhat we’ve built together: We added a system for lenders and borrowers to send and repay money directly on the Giving Credit platform, making it a functional lending tool ready to be integrated with payment platforms like PayPal. We also implemented a reward system using the Giftbit API, enabling cash or gift card rewards without fees to boost participation and move more money to users.\nWe The Action (WTA) is a small nonprofit established by Marc Elias and Laurene Powell Jobs, aimed at leveraging the expertise of government and philanthropic lawyers to promote a more just and equitable society.\nWhat we’ve built together: Able built a platform connecting pro bono lawyers with nonprofits, which boosted lawyer participation, enhanced volunteer experiences, and amplified WTA's impact.\nUpTogether is a community, movement, and platform that supports initiatives in historically undervalued communities to improve lives collectively.\nWhat we’ve built together: We rearchitected their payment platform integrating with new payment providers, improved system observability capturing production issues earlier, and added architecture and design best practices to their process to increase efficiency.\nInvestED, a developing non-profit with the aim to empower high school students to make more informed choices as they prepare for, apply to, and choose which college to attend.\nWhat we’ve built together: Able helped them build their first product that used proprietary outcomes and portfolio methodology to scale their intervention program.\nWishbone is a non-profit that enables low-income high school students to experience life-changing summer programs in an effort to bridge the opportunity gap. \nWhat we’ve built together: Able designed and built the platform that connects students with these opportunities. Since 2012, it has helped 2176 students raise $4,158,601 in funding for summer programs.\nInvesting in a LATAM workforce\nWe incubated and launched a school, Codeable, to provide opportunity and career advancement for engineering students in LATAM. Since inception, it has graduated 9 cohorts of students (and counting!) with a 95% job placement rate.\nView Codeable"
